#Build 1.4.x
-Changed the way that objects are selected to center in binding site determination from AutoLigand. Now by default all
are selected and at each site previously determined docking are made. The results show the affinities for each pose.
-Changed the way that results and box are visualized
-Now we do the docking for every possible site identified by AutoLigand instead of doing it for arbitrary selection
-Added a log that contains all the information of the process
-Progress bars have been changed. Now there is better monitoring of the progress of the docking process
-Output file now contains more information and is better organized
